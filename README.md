A simple implementation of CARL
===============================

Following the prescription in
[Approximating Likelihood Ratios with Calibrated Discriminative
Classifiers](https://arxiv.org/abs/1506.02169)...

`test.py` contains a basic setup.

`cpcarl.utils` contains utility functions for setting up the discriminator and
reweighting.
